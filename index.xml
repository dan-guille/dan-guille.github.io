      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration  Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).
The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>

Hello ~Welcome to my blog~
Being able to use R Studio and Python increases your knowledge stats! Who wouldn’t want to know two extremely popular coding languages?! What’s even more neat is that you can use both at the same time where they can “talk” to one another.
This is done by the library package “reticulate” in R Studio! Once you load the package, you should make sure to specify, which language you want to run by using either {r} or {python}.</description>
